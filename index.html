            <ol type="1">
                <li>Tell your friends about Beer League!</li>
                <li>Because Echo VR is an all-ages game, RAD has politely asked that we refrain from recruiting and/or hyping via the official Echo Discord.</li>
                <li>Members of Beer League should be of legal drinking age according to the laws in their country of residence.  Do not invite someone you know to be too young.  If you are too young to legally drink, please leave this server.</li>
                <li>If you become too inebriated, injured, or ill to play, your night is over, and you will be replaced by a substitute.</li>
                <li>If you Rule 4, you will be made fun of, placed in the Box of Shame, and be a last draft pick next week.</li>
                <li>Trash talk is permitted, but no drama!</li>
                <li>No shirt? No shoes? No one cares.</li>
                <li>Disconnects and technical errors will be handled per ESL standards.</li>
                <li>This is Beer League; we're here to drink and play Echo.  You must be drinking alcohol to participate!</li>
                <li>Have fun!</li>
            </ol>
